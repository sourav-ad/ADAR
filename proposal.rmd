## Overview

This project aims at provifing an overview of different methods and, subsequently, their application on a dataset. We perform regression and classification based tasks on a selected dataset usign the following methods: 

* \textbf{Classification:} Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Nearest Neighbor, Discriminant Analysis. 
* \textbf{Regression:} GPR/SVR, Decision Trees, elementary Neural Networks. 
* \textbf{Misc:} Random forest, Gradient boosting. 


## Aim

The goal is to give on the one hand a easily comprehensible guide (without too many technical details) about the possibilities of machine learning and on the other hand to provide a collection of code allowing to apply the methods directly (available on Github). Moreover we will demonstrate the methods on different data sets and compare the performance using different performance measures (e.g. MSE, MAPLE).    


## Information on the data

As for this project the specific choice of data is not central we will either use build-in R-data sets or download data from easily accessible data repositories. In particular we require the data to be suitable for the individual methods discussed.  


## Preliminary outline of the presentation


* \textbf{Introduction} 
* \textbf{Models:} In this section we introduce the classification/regression models in very hands-on manner. 
* \textbf{Applications:} For each of the problems we first introduce the data set used and then present results applying (some of) the previous introduced methods. For each application we will try to give a "conclusion" which methods works best (in terms of performance measures or visualization). The number of methods and applications discussed will depend on the time restriction of the presentation.
