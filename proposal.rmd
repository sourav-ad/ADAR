## Overview

This project aims at providing an overview of different methods and, subsequently, their application on a dataset. We perform regression and classification based tasks on a selected dataset using a subset of the following methods: 

* \textbf{Classification:} Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Nearest Neighbor, Discriminant Analysis. 
* \textbf{Regression:} GPR/SVR, Decision Trees, elementary Neural Networks. 
* \textbf{Misc:} Random forest, Gradient boosting. 


## Aim

The goal is to provide an easily comprehensible guide about the possibilities of the methods mentioned and to provide accessible R code to implement the methods (available on Github). Further, we will demonstrate the methods on different datasets and compare the performance using several evaluation measures (e.g. MSE, MAPE, etc.).    


## Data

For this project a specific choice of data is not as crucial and we will either use in-built R-datasets or get data from easily accessible open data repositories. In particular we require the datasets to be appropriate for the methods to be discussed.  


## Outline of the Presentation


* A brief introduction. 
* \textbf{Models:} Introduce the classification/regression models in an easy, hands-on manner. 
* \textbf{Applications:} For each problem introduce the dataset used and then present results applying all or some of the introduced methods. For each application we provide a suggestion regarding the most appropriate method (quantified in terms of performance measures or suitable visualization). The methods and applications discussed shall depend on the time limit of the presentation.
