## (Statistical) Classification: What is it anyway?

-The problem of identifying which of a set of categories an observation belongs to.

-E.g. assigning an incoming email to "spam" or "inbox" mailbox.

-Classification can be thought of as two separate problems â€“ binary classification and multiclass classification.

## Methods of Classification

## Dataset

-The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).

-The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms.

## Naive Bayes

-Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features.

-The assumption is that the features are independent, i.e presence of one particular feature does not affect the other. Hence the adjective ``naive".

-Requires a small number of training data to estimate the parameters necessary for classification.

-Bayes theorem expressed as:
$$P(y|X) = \frac{P(X|y)P(y)}{P(X)}$$
-$y$ is the category variable, and $X$ represent the parameters/features.
