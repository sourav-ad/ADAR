# ADAR
Project- Advanced Data Analysis in R

This project aims at providing an overview of different methods and, subsequently, their application on a dataset. We perform regression and classification based tasks on a selected dataset using the following methods: 

* Classification: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Nearest Neighbor, Discriminant Analysis. 
* Regression: GPR/SVR, Decision Trees, elementary Neural Networks. 
* Misc: Random forest, Gradient boosting. 


Aim

The goal is to provide an easily comprehensible guide about the possibilities of the methods mentioned and to provide accessible R code to implement the methods (available on Github). Further, we will demonstrate the methods on different datasets and compare the performance using several evaluation measures (e.g. MSE, MAPE, etc.).
